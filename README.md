RJS: 2020-06-24: I am in the process of moving the code to here, but the latest update is still on ltdevsrv. The ltdevsrv version is the one actaully running in operations. I plan to copy it here and this will become the master source in due course. Currently I cannot get it to build on lt-qc which is why the version on ltdevsrv is still definitive. It can be built staticly on ltdesrv and copied anywhere.
